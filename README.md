Building a professional portfolio while learning how to use media queries in CSS. A media query is using the @media rule to change the CSS when certain conditions are met. For example, when the screen size reaches a certain size, the content in the webpage will adopt a new set of CSS rules.

        margin-left: 40px;

    }
}
```

# Learning points
<!-- Learning points where you would write what you thought was helpful -->
Media queries are very useful becuase you do not have to re-write a whole new stylesheet for mobile screens. You can just put in the @media rule into your existing CSS file and adjust from there. A downside I can see is that if a device has a screen size that is somewhere inbetween the standard sizes, desktop --> tablet --> phone, the website might look funky. You combat this by adding breakpoints for many screen sizes.
